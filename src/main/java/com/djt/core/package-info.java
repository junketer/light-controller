/**
 * Classes forming the Implementation of the light controller program
 * 
 * AlgorithmFactory and the LightAlgoritm interface allows for more algorithms to be implemented
 * Create a concreate implementation of LightAlgorith, and associated new enum value in LightAlgorithmType and
 * add an entry in AlgorithFactory to return the new algorithm
 * 
 * Colour enum defines the colour of the lights
 * If a new colour is added or the order of the colours should change then the LightImpl.init method will need to be adjusted accordingly
 * 
 * Main.NUM_OF_LIGHTS can  be changed to alter the number of lights to create
